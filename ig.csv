That goes for yourself too. People almost always find it difficult to identify and accept their own mistakes and weaknesses. Sometimes it's because they're blind to them, but more often it's because their egos get in the way. Most likely your associates are equally reluctant to point out your mistakes, because they don't want to hurt you. You all need to get over this. More than anything else, what differentiates people who live up to their potential from those who don't is their willingness to look at themselves and others objectively and understand the root causes standing in their way. Because I’m keen to help people know what they’re like, know what the people around them are like, and help them get what they want, I created PrinciplesYou with the help of three great personality experts. It’s free, easy, and fun to take, so check it out and let me know your thoughts. Link in bio. #PrinciplesYou",no,1,0,photo,no,no,na,3,yes,tall,0,na,no
